## About me

|![Image of me](/assets/images/me.jpeg)| Hello! My name is Noelia Oliete Escuín. In 2022, I finished a Computer Engineering degree at the University of Zaragoza. Then, I moved to Barcelona to follow my studies at the Universitat Polítecnica de Catalunya (UPC) on a Master's in Avance Telecommunications. At the same time, I started working at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS), where I could focus on my main research interest, computer architecture and, specifically, cache hierarchies.
